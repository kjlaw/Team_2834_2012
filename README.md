FIRST Robotics Competition Team Website
=======================================

I updated my robotics team's 2011 website to include information for the 2012 competition season.

I added a forum that is open to team members, as well as the public. In the past, we received numerous questions about our website, scouting database, and summer robotics camps. As a result, I decided to create a forum to provide an easier way to communicate with the FIRST community. prettyPhoto was also added to display pop up videos on certain pages.
